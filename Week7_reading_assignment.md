As a math student interested in human activities and interactions on social media, this reading taught me a lot. I agree that participation without condition is the rooted value of digital humanity where the technologies are not. The citizen-scholars raise new questions or design new possibilities, and the newer technologies only bring new tools for analysis. The reading also reminds me of the position of social media. They could be powerful tools for amplifying people's voices globally, but the information generated can be easily manipulated and hard to verify. We need to be extra cautious when performing analysis.  

The discussion of a person's position in the event ("inside" vs. "outside") was inspiring. I never thought of my position as an analyst outside places me in a questionable ethical position of a privileged observer of events that I took no part in. Data science without ethical considerations is dangerous, whether it be protecting personally identifiable data, implicit bias in automated decision-making, the social impacts of digital humanity studies, or the apparent divorce of truth and trust in virtual communication on social networks. 


Question: On page 178, the author mentioned that "Communities are created by clusters of words, which are mentioned in proximity to each other."  
Can you elaborate the idea/theory behind this statement?
