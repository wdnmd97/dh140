### Summary

This artile suggested a new discipline for leadership in the AI era where massive data is available for decision making. In the article, the author defined decision intelligence as a new academic discipline concerned with all aspects of selecting between options. It brings together the best of applied data science, social science, and managerial science into a unified field that helps people use data to improve their lives and the world around them. In short, decision intelligence is the discipline of turning information into better actions at any scale. The article started by introducing some basic terminology and concepts of decision intelligence. Then the author discussed how to utilize the power of data science to make wise decisions. For the data collecting stage, while data engineering is a separate sister discipline and key collaborator to decision intelligence, the decision sciences include a strong tradition of expertise involved in advising the design and curation of fact collection. When it comes to the data science part, the author mentioned that the facts delivered/collected are usually not the facts ideally needed for making decisions. We should expect our approach to change when the facts we have aren’t the facts we need. Maybe they’re one puzzle piece of a much bigger puzzle (as with a sample from a larger population). Thus we can only utilize our data by making leaps beyond the data. 

### Reflection

This article speaks to me because most of my previous data science projects were aimed to help make better decisions. I’ve encountered many situations where the facts I have aren’t the facts I need. The way to resolve this problem is to use the partial facts I have derived to reasonably update my arguments to make them more informed. An interesting example would be predicting the impact of rising global temperature on small fisheries while the collected data suggests temperature is dropping. Since my interest lies in AI aid decision making, this article gave me ideas about the critical demand for decision-making AI. Decision science is not just making calculations but also dealing with decision setup and information processing. I will be aware of people’s various reactions to information when designing AI. Merely relying on pure mathematical rationality is relatively naive and could perform worse than expected.
